    "description": "In the bustling world of retail and distribution, a major company, GlobalSupply, is facing a strategic challenge. It needs to efficiently supply its products to eight different retail stores, each with its own demand for goods. To achieve this, GlobalSupply is considering opening up to eight different distribution centers, but each center comes with its own set of opening costs and has a specific capacity limit. Additionally, the cost of transporting goods from these distribution centers to the retail stores varies, adding another layer of complexity to the decision-making process. GlobalSupply's primary objective is to fulfill the demand at each retail store while minimizing the total cost, which includes both the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of the goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 8\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 8\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n- Center 7: $182,000\n- Center 8: $186,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1 to Stores: $3 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $5 to Store 6, $2 to Store 7, $4 to Store 8\n- From Center 2 to Stores: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $2 to Store 6, $5 to Store 7, $4 to Store 8\n- From Center 3 to Stores: $1 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $4 to Store 7, $3 to Store 8\n- From Center 4 to Stores: $4 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $1 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6, $5 to Store 7, $1 to Store 8\n- From Center 5 to Stores: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $1 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $2 to Store 6, $1 to Store 7, $2 to Store 8\n- From Center 6 to Stores: $5 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $5 to Store 7, $3 to Store 8\n- From Center 7 to Stores: $1 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $2 to Store 6, $4 to Store 7, $5 to Store 8\n- From Center 8 to Stores: $2 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $4 to Store 7, $1 to Store 8\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 695 units\n- Store 2: 737 units\n- Store 3: 452 units\n- Store 4: 616 units\n- Store 5: 587 units\n- Store 6: 779 units\n- Store 7: 892 units\n- Store 8: 440 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1980 units\n- Center 2: 814 units\n- Center 3: 864 units\n- Center 4: 1320 units\n- Center 5: 1952 units\n- Center 6: 1447 units\n- Center 7: 1886 units\n- Center 8: 1962 units\n\nQuestion:\nConsidering these details, what is the optimal total cost for GlobalSupply to open distribution centers and transport goods to meet all retail stores' demands? This cost includes both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores.",
