    "description": "International Wool Company operates a large farm on which sheep are raised. The farm manager determined that for the sheep to grow in the desired fashion, they need at least minimum amounts of four nutrients (the nutrients are nontoxic so the sheep can consume more than the minimum without harm). The manager is considering three different grains to feed the sheep. The nutrients listed are A, B, C, and D. For Grain 1: Nutrient A is present in the amount of 20 units per pound. Nutrient B is present in the amount of 10 units per pound. Nutrient C is present in the amount of 50 units per pound. Nutrient D is present in the amount of 6 units per pound. The cost of Grain 1 is 41 cents per pound. For Grain 2: Nutrient A is present in the amount of 30 units per pound. Nutrient B is present in the amount of 10 units per pound. Nutrient C is present in the amount of 30 units per pound. Nutrient D is present in the amount of 2.5 units per pound. The cost of Grain 2 is 36 cents per pound. For Grain 3: Nutrient A is present in the amount of 70 units per pound. Nutrient B is present in the amount of 0 units per pound. Nutrient C is present in the amount of 0 units per pound. Nutrient D is present in the amount of 10 units per pound. The cost of Grain 3 is 96 cents per pound. The minimum daily requirement for each nutrient is also listed: Nutrient A requires 110 units daily. Nutrient B requires 18 units daily. Nutrient C requires 90 units daily. Nutrient D requires 14 units daily. The manager believes that as long as a sheep receives the minimum daily amount of each nutrient, it will be healthy and produce a standard amount of wool. The manager wants to raise the sheep at minimum cost. Find the minimum cost in cents.",
