    "description": "In the bustling landscape of retail and distribution, EfficientDistro Inc. is at a pivotal point of re-evaluating its logistics strategy to ensure the timely and cost-effective delivery of goods to its consumer base. The company has narrowed down its choice to four potential distribution centers, each with its own set of operational costs and capacities. These centers are tasked with the responsibility of distributing products to four retail stores, spread across different locations, each with its unique demand. The challenge lies in selecting the right mix of distribution centers to open and determining the most efficient distribution routes to minimize the overall operational costs, which include both the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of goods to the retail stores.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 4\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 4\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $5 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4\n- From Center 2: $3 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4\n- From Center 3: $3 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4\n- From Center 4: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 859\n- Store 2: 713\n- Store 3: 421\n- Store 4: 652\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1,547\n- Center 2: 1,656\n- Center 3: 1,274\n- Center 4: 1,882\n\nEfficientDistro Inc. now faces the complex task of deciding which distribution centers to open and how to allocate shipments to meet the demand at each retail store in the most cost-effective manner. The solution must take into account the varying opening costs of the distribution centers, their capacities, the transportation costs involved in shipping goods to the retail stores, and the specific demand at each store location.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for EfficientDistro Inc. to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods to meet all retail stores' demands, including both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?",
