    "description": "Let's say you're on a mission to create the perfect meal plan for yourself. You're focused on getting the right balance of nutrients without digging too deep into your pockets. You have six different food options to consider: Chicken, Oats, Tofu, Rice, Beef, and Salmon. Each of these foods provides a certain amount of protein, carbohydrates, and calories, and they all come with their own distinct prices.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the nutritional content and cost of each food item:\n\n- Chicken: Delivers 14 grams of protein, a single gram of carbohydrates, and 164 calories at a cost of $6.\n- Oats: Gives you 11 grams of protein, 6 grams of carbohydrates, and 210 calories for just $2.\n- Tofu: Offers 8 grams of protein, 12 grams of carbohydrates, and 98 calories at a cost of $9.\n- Rice: Provides 1 gram of protein, a generous 17 grams of carbohydrates, and 92 calories for $3.\n- Beef: Comes packed with 16 grams of protein, 11 grams of carbohydrates, and 211 calories, priced at $7.\n- Salmon: Brings a hefty 19 grams of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 211 calories but costs $9.\n\nYou want to make sure your meal plan meets the following nutritional targets: at least 70 grams of protein, 117 grams of carbohydrates, and 1837 calories. Considering these six foods, what is the least amount of money you need to spend to meet these dietary needs?\nRemember, your response should only contain the optimal value of the cost to meet the requirements.",
