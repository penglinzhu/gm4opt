    "description": "Embark on a journey through a complex network of digital data highways, designed to facilitate the swift and secure transmission of information across 9 strategic relay stations. This network, vital for the operation of a futuristic city, relies on its capacity to handle vast amounts of data, ensuring that communication flows from its source to the intended destination without a hitch.\n\nHere's a detailed blueprint of the data flow capacities (in terabytes per hour) from one relay station to another within this intricate system:\n\n- From Station 0 (Source): Has the capability to dispatch data to Station 1 (15 TB), Station 2 (1 TB), Station 3 (9 TB), Station 4 (18 TB), Station 5 (12 TB), Station 6 (18 TB), Station 7 (6 TB), and Station 8 (17 TB).\n- From Station 1: Can transmit data to Station 0 (14 TB), Station 2 (13 TB), Station 3 (11 TB), Station 4 (14 TB), Station 5 (10 TB), Station 6 (15 TB), Station 7 (4 TB), and Station 8 (15 TB).\n- From Station 2: Can route data to Station 0 (3 TB), Station 3 (2 TB), Station 4 (14 TB), Station 5 (16 TB), Station 6 (7 TB), Station 7 (12 TB), and Station 8 (4 TB).\n- From Station 3: Can forward data to Station 0 (5 TB), Station 1 (20 TB), Station 4 (9 TB), Station 5 (1 TB), Station 6 (12 TB), Station 7 (1 TB), and Station 8 (20 TB).\n- From Station 4: Can push data to Station 0 (11 TB), Station 1 (18 TB), Station 2 (12 TB), Station 3 (3 TB), Station 5 (4 TB), Station 6 (16 TB), Station 7 (15 TB), and Station 8 (2 TB).\n- From Station 5: Can channel data to Station 0 (13 TB), Station 1 (8 TB), Station 2 (8 TB), Station 3 (6 TB), Station 4 (4 TB), Station 6 (8 TB), Station 7 (10 TB), and Station 8 (11 TB).\n- From Station 6: Can send data to Station 0 (12 TB), Station 1 (1 TB), Station 2 (3 TB), Station 3 (4 TB), Station 4 (11 TB), Station 5 (8 TB), Station 7 (10 TB), and Station 8 (19 TB).\n- From Station 7: Can relay data to Station 0 (18 TB), Station 1 (3 TB), Station 2 (9 TB), Station 3 (5 TB), Station 4 (9 TB), Station 5 (17 TB), Station 6 (10 TB), and Station 8 (13 TB).\n- From Station 8 (Destination): Data can be reflected back to Station 0 (9 TB), Station 1 (8 TB), Station 2 (12 TB), Station 3 (2 TB), Station 4 (5 TB), Station 5 (2 TB), Station 6 (16 TB), and Station 7 (5 TB).\n\nIn this virtual scenario, a capacity of \"0\" indicates that there is no direct data link between the specified stations, requiring the data to be rerouted through other nodes in the network.\n\nYour mission is to calculate the maximum amount of data (in terabytes per hour) that can be transmitted from Station 0 (the source) to Station 8 (the destination), ensuring that the traffic flowing through each data link does not exceed its maximum capacity. What is the optimal amount of data that can be relayed from the source to the destination per hour?",
