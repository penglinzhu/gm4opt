    "description": "In the bustling world of retail, SupplyChain Innovations is at a crucial crossroads. With a diverse network of five retail stores, each with its own unique demand, the company is exploring options to establish a network of distribution centers that can efficiently fulfill these demands at the lowest possible cost. The challenge lies in selecting from seven potential distribution centers, each with its own set of opening costs and capacities, alongside varying transportation costs to the stores. The ultimate goal is to devise a solution that minimizes the total expense involved, which includes the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of delivering goods to the retail outlets.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 7\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 5\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n- Center 7: $182,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $3 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5\n- From Center 2: $5 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 3: $5 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5\n- From Center 4: $4 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $1 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5\n- From Center 5: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 6: $4 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5\n- From Center 7: $5 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 715\n- Store 2: 413\n- Store 3: 641\n- Store 4: 745\n- Store 5: 964\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1697\n- Center 2: 891\n- Center 3: 1755\n- Center 4: 1308\n- Center 5: 1575\n- Center 6: 834\n- Center 7: 1005\n\nSupplyChain Innovations seeks to establish a distribution framework that ensures each retail store's demand is met without exceeding the capacities of the chosen distribution centers. The varying transportation costs from each center present a complex puzzle that requires an optimal combination of distribution centers to be activated and the best logistical paths to be chosen to fulfill the store demands efficiently.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for SupplyChain Innovations to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods to meet all the retail stores' demands, considering both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?",
