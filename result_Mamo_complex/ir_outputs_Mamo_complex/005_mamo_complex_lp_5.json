    "description": "Imagine you're a college student aiming to balance your diet and budget. You have identified nine different food items from your local grocery store that you can include in your menu: Chicken, Rice, Apples, Steak, Lentils, Fish, Tofu, Cheese, and Bread. Each of these foods provides varying amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and calories, and each comes with its own price.\n\nHere is the detailed nutritional content and cost for each food item:\n\n- Chicken: Gives you 15 grams of protein, 18 grams of carbohydrates, and 300 calories for $4.\n- Rice: Offers 1 gram of protein, 25 grams of carbohydrates, and 267 calories for $2.\n- Apples: Provide 1 gram of protein, 21 grams of carbohydrates, and 266 calories for $5.\n- Steak: Contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of carbohydrates, and 119 calories for a higher cost of $10.\n- Lentils: These give 3 grams of protein, 7 grams of carbohydrates, and 166 calories for just $2.\n- Fish: Delivers 17 grams of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 129 calories for $8.\n- Tofu: Offers a substantial 18 grams of protein, 27 grams of carbohydrates, and 216 calories for $10.\n- Cheese: Gives 12 grams of protein, 17 grams of carbohydrates, and 76 calories for $9.\n- Bread: Provides 2 grams of protein, a massive 30 grams of carbohydrates, and 258 calories for $4.\n\nYour daily dietary goal is to consume at least 90 grams of protein, 105 grams of carbohydrates, and 1805 calories. Your challenge is to figure out how to meet these nutritional requirements from the food options mentioned above while spending the least amount of money. So, what is the least amount of money you need to spend to meet your daily dietary requirements? Please note that the response should be a single answer, asking for only the optimal value.",
