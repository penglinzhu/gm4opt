    "description": "SupplyChain Solutions Inc. is facing a complex logistical challenge in optimizing its distribution network. With five retail stores requiring steady supplies and six possible distribution centers to choose from, the task at hand is to find the most cost-effective way to keep the stores well-stocked. Each distribution center has its own fixed opening cost and a maximum supply capacity, while the cost to transport goods from these centers to the stores varies. The goal is straightforward yet daunting: to fulfill the demand of each retail store while minimizing the total operational cost, which includes both the opening of distribution centers and the transportation of goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 6\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 5\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $2 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5\n- From Center 2: $4 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 3: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 4: $2 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5\n- From Center 5: $3 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 6: $3 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 884\n- Store 2: 420\n- Store 3: 566\n- Store 4: 673\n- Store 5: 787\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1400\n- Center 2: 1115\n- Center 3: 813\n- Center 4: 1041\n- Center 5: 1576\n- Center 6: 1364\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for SupplyChain Solutions Inc. to open distribution centers and transport goods to meet all retail stores' demands, including both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?",
