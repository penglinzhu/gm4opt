    "description": "Welcome to the fictional city of Aquaville, where the city's administration is working on a groundbreaking project to maximize the efficiency of its new water distribution network. This network is designed to ensure that every corner of the city has access to water, especially in times of need. The system is made up of 9 pivotal stations - including the main water source and the central distribution hub - connected by a series of pipelines with varying capacities.\n\nHere's a closer look at the capacities (in thousands of gallons per hour) that each pipeline can handle, showcasing the maximum flow from one station to another across the city:\n\n- From Station 0 (Source): Water can be directed to Station 1 (2 gallons), Station 2 (8 gallons), Station 3 (17 gallons), Station 4 (16 gallons), Station 5 (20 gallons), Station 6 (15 gallons), Station 7 (12 gallons), and Station 8 (9 gallons).\n- From Station 1: Water can flow to Station 0 (4 gallons), Station 2 (11 gallons), Station 3 (7 gallons), Station 4 (3 gallons), Station 5 (19 gallons), Station 6 (10 gallons), Station 7 (19 gallons), and Station 8 (8 gallons).\n- From Station 2: Water can move to Station 0 (14 gallons), Station 1 (7 gallons), Station 3 (7 gallons), Station 4 (13 gallons), Station 5 (19 gallons), Station 6 (18 gallons), Station 7 (20 gallons), and Station 8 (5 gallons).\n- From Station 3: Water can be sent to Station 0 (17 gallons), Station 1 (17 gallons), Station 2 (7 gallons), Station 4 (11 gallons), Station 5 (7 gallons), Station 6 (17 gallons), Station 7 (0 gallons), and Station 8 (10 gallons).\n- From Station 4: Water can be distributed to Station 0 (20 gallons), Station 1 (10 gallons), Station 2 (2 gallons), Station 3 (18 gallons), Station 5 (15 gallons), Station 6 (8 gallons), Station 7 (6 gallons), and Station 8 (18 gallons).\n- From Station 5: Water can be channeled to Station 0 (4 gallons), Station 1 (9 gallons), Station 2 (12 gallons), Station 3 (1 gallon), Station 4 (17 gallons), Station 6 (0 gallons), Station 7 (13 gallons), and Station 8 (18 gallons).\n- From Station 6: Water can flow to Station 0 (12 gallons), Station 1 (15 gallons), Station 2 (12 gallons), Station 3 (19 gallons), Station 4 (18 gallons), Station 5 (19 gallons), Station 7 (6 gallons), and Station 8 (17 gallons).\n- From Station 7: Water can be directed to Station 0 (14 gallons), Station 1 (1 gallon), Station 2 (17 gallons), Station 3 (20 gallons), Station 4 (11 gallons), Station 5 (20 gallons), Station 6 (6 gallons), and Station 8 (4 gallons).\n- From Station 8 (Destination): Water can be sent back to Station 0 (19 gallons), Station 1 (3 gallons), Station 2 (19 gallons), Station 3 (12 gallons), Station 4 (8 gallons), Station 5 (18 gallons), Station 6 (17 gallons), and Station 7 (13 gallons).\n\nIn this intricate network, a capacity of \"0\" implies that there is no direct connection for water flow between those two specific stations.\n\nThe critical mission is to determine the maximum quantity of water that can be efficiently distributed from Station 0, the primary source, to Station 8, the central distribution hub, per hour. The flow through each pipeline must not exceed its maximum specified capacity.\n\nWhat is the optimal amount of water (in thousands of gallons per hour) that can be transported from the source to the distribution hub, ensuring the network operates at its maximum potential?",
