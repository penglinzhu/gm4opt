    "description": "In a challenging and complex market, SwiftLogistics is at a crossroads to design an efficient distribution network to fulfill the needs of eight retail stores scattered across various locations. The company has the opportunity to choose from six potential distribution centers, each with its unique opening costs and capacities. The primary goal is to ensure all retail stores are adequately supplied while minimizing the total operational costs, which include both the opening of distribution centers and the transportation of goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 6\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 8\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $2 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $3 to Store 7, $5 to Store 8\n- From Center 2: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5, $1 to Store 6, $4 to Store 7, $2 to Store 8\n- From Center 3: $5 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $1 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6, $2 to Store 7, $4 to Store 8\n- From Center 4: $4 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6, $5 to Store 7, $3 to Store 8\n- From Center 5: $5 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $2 to Store 7, $2 to Store 8\n- From Center 6: $1 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $4 to Store 7, $4 to Store 8\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 908 units\n- Store 2: 434 units\n- Store 3: 605 units\n- Store 4: 480 units\n- Store 5: 961 units\n- Store 6: 787 units\n- Store 7: 401 units\n- Store 8: 789 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1365 units\n- Center 2: 1929 units\n- Center 3: 1502 units\n- Center 4: 1201 units\n- Center 5: 1529 units\n- Center 6: 961 units\n\nSwiftLogistics now faces the intricate task of determining which distribution centers to open and how to distribute goods to meet the demands of all eight retail stores efficiently. The strategy must ensure that the total cost, including opening and transportation expenses, is minimized.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for SwiftLogistics to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods to satisfy the demands of all eight retail stores, keeping in mind the goal of minimizing the combined opening and transportation costs?",
