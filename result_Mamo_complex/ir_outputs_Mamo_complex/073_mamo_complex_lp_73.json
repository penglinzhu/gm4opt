    "description": "SupplyLink, a major supplier, is looking to optimize its distribution network to ensure the efficient supply of goods to its five retail stores from a selection of five potential distribution centers. Each distribution center incurs an initial opening cost and has a limit on how much it can supply. The transportation cost of goods from these centers to the retail stores also varies. The goal is to meet the demand at each retail store at minimal total cost, which includes the opening costs of distribution centers and the transportation cost of the goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 5\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 5\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: 151,000\n- Center 2: 192,000\n- Center 3: 114,000\n- Center 4: 171,000\n- Center 5: 160,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $5 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5\n- From Center 2: $5 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5\n- From Center 3: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5\n- From Center 4: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5\n- From Center 5: $1 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 589\n- Store 2: 962\n- Store 3: 966\n- Store 4: 643\n- Store 5: 904\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1954\n- Center 2: 1446\n- Center 3: 820\n- Center 4: 1640\n- Center 5: 966\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the minimum total cost that SupplyLink will incur to open distribution centers and transport goods in order to satisfy all retail stores' demands? This total cost includes both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores.",
