    "description": "In a vast network of canals interconnecting 9 strategic reservoirs, engineers have meticulously mapped out the maximum capacities for water transfer (in millions of gallons per day) between each reservoir to facilitate efficient water distribution across a sprawling agricultural region. These reservoirs, from the source (Reservoir 0) to the final distribution point (Reservoir 8), are crucial in ensuring that water reaches the farthest corners of the region, especially during peak farming season.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of the water transfer capacities between reservoirs:\n\n- From Reservoir 0: Water can be directed to Reservoir 1 (6 million gallons), Reservoir 2 (1 million gallons), Reservoir 3 (14 million gallons), Reservoir 4 (20 million gallons), Reservoir 5 (6 million gallons), Reservoir 6 (13 million gallons), Reservoir 7 (13 million gallons), and Reservoir 8 (15 million gallons).\n- From Reservoir 1: Water can flow to Reservoir 0 (2 million gallons), Reservoir 2 (5 million gallons), Reservoir 3 (5 million gallons), Reservoir 4 (13 million gallons), Reservoir 5 (5 million gallons), Reservoir 6 (12 million gallons), Reservoir 7 (9 million gallons), and Reservoir 8 (15 million gallons).\n- From Reservoir 2: Capacities are to Reservoir 0 (15 million gallons), Reservoir 3 (8 million gallons), Reservoir 4 (16 million gallons), Reservoir 5 (9 million gallons), Reservoir 6 (19 million gallons), Reservoir 7 (15 million gallons), and Reservoir 8 (6 million gallons).\n- From Reservoir 3: Water can be transferred to Reservoir 0 (13 million gallons), Reservoir 1 (8 million gallons), Reservoir 4 (14 million gallons), Reservoir 5 (12 million gallons), Reservoir 6 (9 million gallons), Reservoir 7 (1 million gallons), and Reservoir 8 (2 million gallons).\n- From Reservoir 4: Channels lead to Reservoir 0 (4 million gallons), Reservoir 1 (14 million gallons), Reservoir 2 (19 million gallons), Reservoir 3 (16 million gallons), Reservoir 5 (14 million gallons), Reservoir 6 (11 million gallons), Reservoir 7 (11 million gallons), and Reservoir 8 (2 million gallons).\n- From Reservoir 5: Water is distributed to Reservoir 0 (19 million gallons), Reservoir 1 (18 million gallons), Reservoir 2 (5 million gallons), Reservoir 3 (20 million gallons), Reservoir 4 (9 million gallons), Reservoir 6 (11 million gallons), Reservoir 7 (5 million gallons), and Reservoir 8 (7 million gallons).\n- From Reservoir 6: The flow is to Reservoir 0 (11 million gallons), Reservoir 1 (14 million gallons), Reservoir 2 (20 million gallons), Reservoir 3 (17 million gallons), Reservoir 4 (11 million gallons), Reservoir 5 (13 million gallons), Reservoir 7 (11 million gallons), and Reservoir 8 (16 million gallons).\n- From Reservoir 7: It can send to Reservoir 0 (6 million gallons), Reservoir 1 (2 million gallons), Reservoir 2 (17 million gallons), Reservoir 4 (10 million gallons), Reservoir 5 (13 million gallons), Reservoir 6 (17 million gallons), and Reservoir 8 (9 million gallons).\n- From Reservoir 8: Water can flow back to Reservoir 0 (8 million gallons), Reservoir 1 (9 million gallons), Reservoir 2 (7 million gallons), Reservoir 3 (18 million gallons), Reservoir 4 (12 million gallons), Reservoir 5 (13 million gallons), Reservoir 6 (5 million gallons), and Reservoir 7 (9 million gallons).\n\nA \"0\" indicates that there is no direct water transfer capability between those two reservoirs.\n\nThe challenge is to optimize this water distribution system to ascertain the maximum possible water transfer from Reservoir 0 (the source) to Reservoir 8 (the final distribution point) per day. What is the optimal value of water (in millions of gallons) that can be transferred from the source to the final distribution point per day?",
