    "description": "You have been assigned as the personal dietitian for a professional athlete, who is intent on maintaining a strict diet while also minimizing their grocery bill. You have six different food items to utilize: Eggs, Chicken, Tofu, Salmon, Brown Rice, and Spinach. Each of these food items provides specific amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and calories, and each comes at a different cost.\n\nHere's a quick breakdown of what each food offers and its cost:\n\n- Eggs: Provide 1 gram of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 211 calories for $10.\n- Chicken: Offers 4 grams of protein, 10 grams of carbohydrates, and 256 calories for $9.\n- Tofu: Delivers a whopping 13 grams of protein, 9 grams of carbohydrates, and 273 calories for just $2.\n- Salmon: Gives 8 grams of protein, 3 grams of carbohydrates, and 54 calories for $10.\n- Brown Rice: Provides 7 grams of protein, 13 grams of carbohydrates, and 93 calories for $8.\n- Spinach: Packs in 8 grams of protein, 16 grams of carbohydrates, and 52 calories for only $1.\n\nThe athlete's nutritional goals are at least 60 grams of protein, 122 grams of carbohydrates, and 2028 calories daily. \n\nYour challenge is to design the most cost-effective daily meal plan that meets all these nutritional targets using these six food options. What is the least amount of money the athlete would have to spend to meet their nutritional requirements?",
