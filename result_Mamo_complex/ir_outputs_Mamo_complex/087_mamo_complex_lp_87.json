    "description": "The nationwide retail chain, MarketHub, is in the process of restructuring its distribution network to efficiently cater to the demands of its five retail stores spread across different regions. The strategic decision involves selecting from eight potential distribution centers, each with its unique operational costs and capacities. The goal is to ensure that each retail store's demand is met with the lowest possible total cost, a comprehensive figure that includes the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of the goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 8\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 5\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n- Center 7: $182,000\n- Center 8: $186,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $3 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5\n- From Center 2: $5 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 3: $5 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5\n- From Center 4: $4 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $1 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5\n- From Center 5: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 6: $4 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5\n- From Center 7: $5 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5\n- From Center 8: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 964 units\n- Store 2: 739 units\n- Store 3: 491 units\n- Store 4: 766 units\n- Store 5: 854 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1308 units\n- Center 2: 1575 units\n- Center 3: 834 units\n- Center 4: 1005 units\n- Center 5: 1904 units\n- Center 6: 1825 units\n- Center 7: 1821 units\n- Center 8: 1365 units\n\nMarketHub aims to optimize the balance between maintaining an efficient supply chain and minimizing costs. The challenge is to select the right combination of distribution centers to open and manage the flow of goods to the stores in a way that meets all the demand while keeping both opening and transportation costs as low as possible.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for MarketHub to open distribution centers and transport goods to fully satisfy the demands of all five retail stores, including both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?",
