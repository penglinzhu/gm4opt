    "description": "GlobalSupply Inc. is at a crucial juncture in streamlining its logistics to efficiently service six retail outlets spread across different locations. The company has narrowed down its options to four possible distribution centers, each with unique characteristics, including varying operational costs and different capacities for handling supply. Moreover, the cost to transport goods from these centers to each retail outlet is not uniform, adding layers of complexity to the decision-making process. The overarching goal for GlobalSupply Inc. is to ensure that the demands of all retail stores are met at the lowest possible total cost, incorporating both the opening expenses for these distribution centers and the costs associated with transporting goods to the stores.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 4\n- Number of Retail Stores to be Supplied: 6\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $5 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6\n- From Center 2: $5 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6\n- From Center 3: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $2 to Store 6\n- From Center 4: $5 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $1 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 910 units\n- Store 2: 875 units\n- Store 3: 589 units\n- Store 4: 962 units\n- Store 5: 966 units\n- Store 6: 643 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1631 units\n- Center 2: 1954 units\n- Center 3: 1446 units\n- Center 4: 820 units\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for GlobalSupply Inc. to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods in such a way that all retail stores' demands are fulfilled? This total should encompass both the operational opening costs and the logistical costs of supply to the outlets.",
