    "description": "Distribution Dynamics Inc. has a strategic challenge to efficiently supply its seven retail stores from a choice of five potential distribution centers. This operation has to manage not only the differing opening costs of each distribution center but also the variability in their capacity to meet demands and the transportation costs involved in shipping goods to each retail store. The company aims to fulfill the demand at each retail location while minimizing the total cost involved, which encompasses the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of the goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 5\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 7\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $5 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $5 to Store 6, $4 to Store 7\n- From Center 2: $3 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6, $5 to Store 7\n- From Center 3: $1 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $1 to Store 6, $1 to Store 7\n- From Center 4: $3 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6, $4 to Store 7\n- From Center 5: $4 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $5 to Store 6, $1 to Store 7\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 566 units\n- Store 2: 673 units\n- Store 3: 787 units\n- Store 4: 1000 units\n- Store 5: 715 units\n- Store 6: 413 units\n- Store 7: 641 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1576 units\n- Center 2: 1364 units\n- Center 3: 1697 units\n- Center 4: 891 units\n- Center 5: 1755 units\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for Distribution Dynamics Inc. to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods in order to meet all retail stores' demands at the lowest possible cost, taking into account both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?",
