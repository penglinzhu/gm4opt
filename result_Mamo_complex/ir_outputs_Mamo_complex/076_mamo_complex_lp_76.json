    "description": "Global Supply Network Inc. is at a pivotal moment in redesigning its distribution strategy to ensure efficient delivery of products to six retail stores. The decision revolves around selecting the most cost-effective combination of distribution centers from nine possible locations. Each distribution center has its unique opening cost and a maximum capacity it can supply. Furthermore, the cost of transporting goods from these centers to the retail stores varies significantly. The challenge lies in fulfilling the demand at each retail store while minimizing the overall cost, including the expenses of opening distribution centers and the transportation cost of goods.\n\nGiven Data:\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 9\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 6\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: 151,000\n- Center 2: 192,000\n- Center 3: 114,000\n- Center 4: 171,000\n- Center 5: 160,000\n- Center 6: 120,000\n- Center 7: 182,000\n- Center 8: 186,000\n- Center 9: 174,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $3 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5, $2 to Store 6\n- From Center 2: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6\n- From Center 3: $2 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $1 to Store 5, $3 to Store 6\n- From Center 4: $3 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6\n- From Center 5: $4 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $5 to Store 6\n- From Center 6: $1 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5, $2 to Store 6\n- From Center 7: $2 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6\n- From Center 8: $4 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $3 to Store 5, $1 to Store 6\n- From Center 9: $4 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5, $4 to Store 6\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 876 units\n- Store 2: 801 units\n- Store 3: 955 units\n- Store 4: 561 units\n- Store 5: 601 units\n- Store 6: 669 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1615 units\n- Center 2: 1255 units\n- Center 3: 1816 units\n- Center 4: 1095 units\n- Center 5: 1519 units\n- Center 6: 1137 units\n- Center 7: 1678 units\n- Center 8: 1876 units\n- Center 9: 1591 units\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for Global Supply Network Inc. to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods to fully meet the demands of all six retail stores? This cost includes the opening costs of the chosen distribution centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores.",
