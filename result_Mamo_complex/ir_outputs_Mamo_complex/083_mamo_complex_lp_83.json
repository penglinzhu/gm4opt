    "description": "GlobalSupply Inc. is at a crossroads in revamping its logistics operations to efficiently cater to the needs of five retail stores spread across different locations. The company can choose from nine potential distribution centers, each with its unique setup cost and supply capacity. Moreover, the transportation costs per unit from these distribution centers to the retail stores vary, making the decision complex. The ultimate goal for GlobalSupply Inc. is to fulfill the demand at each retail store while minimizing the total cost, which includes the opening costs of the distribution centers and the transportation costs of the goods to the stores.\n\nGiven Data:\n\n- Number of Potential Distribution Centers: 9\n- Number of Retail Stores Needing Supply: 5\n\nOpening Costs for Each Distribution Center (in dollars):\n- Center 1: $151,000\n- Center 2: $192,000\n- Center 3: $114,000\n- Center 4: $171,000\n- Center 5: $160,000\n- Center 6: $120,000\n- Center 7: $182,000\n- Center 8: $186,000\n- Center 9: $174,000\n\nTransportation Cost Per Unit from Each Distribution Center to Retail Stores (in dollars):\n- From Center 1: $3 to Store 1, $5 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5\n- From Center 2: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5\n- From Center 3: $1 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $2 to Store 3, $5 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 4: $1 to Store 1, $1 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $2 to Store 5\n- From Center 5: $4 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $3 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 6: $1 to Store 1, $3 to Store 2, $5 to Store 3, $3 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5\n- From Center 7: $1 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $1 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n- From Center 8: $2 to Store 1, $2 to Store 2, $1 to Store 3, $2 to Store 4, $5 to Store 5\n- From Center 9: $2 to Store 1, $4 to Store 2, $4 to Store 3, $4 to Store 4, $4 to Store 5\n\nDemand of Each Retail Store (in units):\n- Store 1: 908 units\n- Store 2: 434 units\n- Store 3: 605 units\n- Store 4: 480 units\n- Store 5: 961 units\n\nSupply Capacity of Each Distribution Center (in units):\n- Center 1: 1825 units\n- Center 2: 1821 units\n- Center 3: 1365 units\n- Center 4: 1929 units\n- Center 5: 1502 units\n- Center 6: 1201 units\n- Center 7: 1529 units\n- Center 8: 961 units\n- Center 9: 1001 units\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for GlobalSupply Inc. to open distribution centers and transport goods to meet all retail stores' demands, including both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?",
