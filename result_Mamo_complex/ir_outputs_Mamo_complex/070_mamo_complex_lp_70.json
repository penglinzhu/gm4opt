    "description": "Welcome to the challenge of optimizing the network of a futuristic transportation system that interconnects 7 strategic hubs across a thriving metropolis. These hubs, ranging from the central dispatch center to the main distribution hub, are connected by a network of high-speed transit lanes, each with a distinct capacity limitation for vehicles per hour. \n\nHere's a breakdown of the transit system's capabilities, indicating the maximum number of vehicles that can move from one hub to another within an hour:\n\n- From Hub 0 (Central Dispatch): Vehicles can move to Hub 1 (15 vehicles), Hub 2 (2 vehicles), Hub 3 (16 vehicles), Hub 4 (3 vehicles), Hub 5 (5 vehicles), and Hub 6 (3 vehicles).\n- From Hub 1: Vehicles can move to Hub 0 (7 vehicles), Hub 4 (19 vehicles), Hub 5 (15 vehicles), and Hub 6 (16 vehicles).\n- From Hub 2: Vehicles can move to Hub 0 (11 vehicles), Hub 1 (14 vehicles), Hub 3 (14 vehicles), Hub 4 (8 vehicles), Hub 5 (11 vehicles), and Hub 6 (6 vehicles).\n- From Hub 3: Vehicles can move to Hub 0 (17 vehicles), Hub 1 (11 vehicles), Hub 2 (11 vehicles), Hub 4 (11 vehicles), Hub 5 (16 vehicles), and Hub 6 (19 vehicles).\n- From Hub 4: Vehicles can move to Hub 0 (10 vehicles), Hub 1 (4 vehicles), Hub 2 (17 vehicles), Hub 3 (20 vehicles), Hub 5 (12 vehicles), and Hub 6 (17 vehicles).\n- From Hub 5: Vehicles can move to Hub 0 (3 vehicles), Hub 2 (4 vehicles), Hub 3 (5 vehicles), Hub 4 (20 vehicles), and Hub 6 (4 vehicles).\n- From Hub 6 (Main Distribution Hub): Vehicles can move back to Hub 0 (15 vehicles), Hub 1 (2 vehicles), Hub 2 (15 vehicles), Hub 3 (18 vehicles), Hub 4 (17 vehicles), and Hub 5 (7 vehicles).\n\nIn this advanced transit network, a capacity of \"0\" indicates that there is no direct transit lane connecting two specific hubs.\n\nThe objective is to determine the maximum capacity of vehicles that can be dispatched from Hub 0 (the Central Dispatch Center) to Hub 6 (the Main Distribution Hub) per hour, while ensuring that the flow through each transit lane does not exceed its specified capacity limit. \n\nWhat is the maximum number of vehicles that can be optimally dispatched from the Central Dispatch Center to the Main Distribution Hub within an hour?",
