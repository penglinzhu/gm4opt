Each city in this network is connected by high-capacity routes, with the ability to transport a significant volume of goods measured in thousands of tons.\n\nHere's a detailed layout of the transportation capacities between each pair of cities:\n\n- From City 0 (Central Hub): Cargo can be sent to City 1 (1 ton), City 2 (16 tons), City 3 (8 tons), City 4 (18 tons), City 5 (4 tons), City 6 (0 tons, indicating no direct route), City 7 (8 tons), and City 8 (5 tons).\n- From City 1: Cargo can be dispatched to City 0 (15 tons), City 2 (11 tons), City 3 (8 tons), City 4 (13 tons), City 5 (2 tons), City 6 (1 ton), City 7 (7 tons), and City 8 (6 tons).\n- From City 2: Shipments can go to City 0 (15 tons), City 1 (4 tons), City 3 (3 tons), City 4 (1 ton), City 5 (13 tons), City 6 (13 tons), City 7 (11 tons), and City 8 (9 tons).\n- From City 3: Goods can be transported to City 0 (4 tons), City 1 (16 tons), City 2 (8 tons), City 4 (12 tons), City 5 (18 tons), City 6 (19 tons), City 7 (8 tons), and City 8 (11 tons).\n- From City 4: Cargo movement is possible to City 0 (4 tons), City 1 (19 tons), City 2 (3 tons), City 3 (2 tons), City 5 (6 tons), City 6 (1 ton), City 7 (13 tons), and City 8 (14 tons).\n- From City 5: Shipments can be directed to City 0 (6 tons), City 1 (19 tons), City 2 (15 tons), City 3 (10 tons), City 4 (16 tons), City 6 (17 tons), City 7 (15 tons), and City 8 (17 tons).\n- From City 6: Cargo can be routed to City 0 (13 tons), City 1 (7 tons), City 2 (13 tons), City 3 (4 tons), City 4 (14 tons), City 5 (3 tons), City 7 (8 tons), and City 8 (8 tons).\n- From City 7: Goods can be moved to City 0 (10 tons), City 1 (6 tons), City 2 (19 tons), City 3 (1 ton), City 4 (12 tons), City 5 (6 tons), City 6 (9 tons), and City 8 (14 tons).\n- From City 8 (Key Distribution Center): This city receives and dispatches goods but primarily serves as the endpoint for cargo coming from the Central Hub.\n\nA capacity of \"0\" in this context indicates that there is no established route for direct cargo transport between those two cities.\n\nThe challenge is to determine the maximum amount of cargo, in thousands of tons, that can be transported from the Central Hub (City 0) to the Key Distribution Center (City 8), ensuring that the flow of goods through each route does not surpass its highest capacity.

This network is composed of 8 crucial nodes, each representing a key junction point in the electrical distribution system. The nodes range from the primary power plant, where electricity is generated, to a final distribution center, from which electricity is routed to meet the city's demands.\n\nThe capacity of each tunnel, measured in thousands of kilowatts per hour (kWh), dictates the maximum amount of electricity that can flow between any two nodes. The connections and their capacities are as follows:\n\n- From the Power Plant (Node 0): Electricity can be sent to Node 1 (2 kWh), Node 2 (1 kWh), Node 3 (1 kWh), Node 4 (8 kWh), Node 5 (17 kWh), Node 6 (6 kWh), and Node 7 (7 kWh).\n- From Node 1: Electricity can flow to the Power Plant (4 kWh), Node 2 (14 kWh), Node 3 (14 kWh), Node 4 (13 kWh), Node 5 (19 kWh), Node 6 (4 kWh), and Node 7 (19 kWh).\n- From Node 2: Electricity can be distributed to the Power Plant (6 kWh), Node 1 (16 kWh), Node 3 (3 kWh), Node 4 (10 kWh), Node 5 (7 kWh), Node 6 (18 kWh), and Node 7 (10 kWh).\n- From Node 3: Electricity can travel to the Power Plant (19 kWh), Node 1 (4 kWh), Node 2 (15 kWh), Node 4 (6 kWh), Node 5 (1 kWh), Node 6 (17 kWh), and Node 7 (9 kWh).\n- From Node 4: Electricity can be dispatched to the Power Plant (12 kWh), Node 1 (15 kWh), Node 2 (3 kWh), Node 3 (14 kWh), Node 5 (18 kWh), Node 6 (20 kWh), and Node 7 (14 kWh).\n- From Node 5: Electricity can move to the Power Plant (20 kWh), Node 1 (5 kWh), Node 2 (19 kWh), Node 3 (9 kWh), Node 4 (20 kWh), Node 6 (10 kWh), and Node 7 (6 kWh).\n- From Node 6: Electricity can be sent to the Power Plant (9 kWh), Node 1 (14 kWh), Node 2 (12 kWh), Node 3 (16 kWh), Node 4 (19 kWh), Node 5 (3 kWh), and Node 7 (10 kWh).\n- From Node 7 (Final Distribution Center): Electricity can return to the Power Plant (20 kWh), Node 1 (16 kWh), Node 2 (6 kWh), Node 3 (16 kWh), Node 4 (8 kWh), Node 5 (16 kWh), and Node 6 (4 kWh).\n\nIn this electrical network, a capacity of \"0\" indicates no direct tunnel connection for electricity flow between those two nodes.\n\nThe challenge is to compute the maximum amount of electricity that can be efficiently distributed from the Power Plant (Node 0) to the Final Distribution Center (Node 7) per hour, ensuring that the flow through each tunnel does not exceed its maximum capacity.

This intricate system, designed to ensure the smooth and efficient delivery of water, consists of channels with varying capacities, reflecting the maximum volumes of water (in thousands of gallons per hour) that can traverse these connections without causing overflow or damage.\n\nHere's a detailed look at the capacities of each channel in this vital network:\n\n- From Distribution Center 0 (Source), the water can be directed to Centers 1 through 8 with capacities of 9, 7, 18, 0, 0, 7, 0, and 2 thousand gallons per hour, respectively.\n- Center 1 has the capability to forward water to other centers, including sending 15, 11, 5, 20, 15, 18, 9, and 15 thousand gallons per hour to Centers 0 through 8 (excluding itself).\n- Similarly, the capacities from Center 2 to others are marked by flows of 3, 8, 0, 10, 16, 18, 8, 0, and 20 thousand gallons per hour to Centers 0 through 8, respectively.\n- The flow continues from Center 3 with capacities of 13, 3, 7, 0, 20, 13, 16, 6, and 20 thousand gallons per hour to the respective centers.\n- From Center 4, water can be distributed with capacities of 7, 20, 2, 4, 0, 9, 3, 14, and 2 thousand gallons per hour.\n- Center 5 allows for a distribution flow of 17, 10, 5, 1, 4, 0, 4, 3, and 20 thousand gallons per hour towards the respective centers.\n- The network from Center 6 can support flows of 0, 20, 10, 10, 15, 5, 0, 1, and 10 thousand gallons per hour.\n- From Center 7, water can be directed with capacities of 10, 3, 9, 4, 3, 13, 18, 0, and 20 thousand gallons per hour.\n- Finally, Center 8 can send back or redistribute water with capacities of 2, 12, 10, 5, 15, 14, 0, 10, and 0 thousand gallons per hour to the respective centers.\n\nIn this network, a capacity of \"0\" indicates the absence of a direct channel between two centers, necessitating the redirection of flow through other centers to ensure connectivity.\n\nGiven this complex and dynamic system, the city's water management team faces the challenging task of determining the maximum volume of water that can be efficiently distributed from Distribution Center 0 (the source) to all other centers, culminating at the final node (Center 8) which represents the city's outskirts. This calculation is crucial for optimizing the water supply and meeting the growing needs of the city's population.\n\nWhat is the maximum amount of water (in thousands of gallons per hour) that can

The varying transportation costs from each center present a complex puzzle that requires an optimal combination of distribution centers to be activated and the best logistical paths to be chosen to fulfill the store demands efficiently.\n\nQuestion:\nWhat is the optimal total cost for SupplyChain Innovations to open the necessary distribution centers and transport goods to meet all the retail stores' demands, considering both the opening costs of the centers and the transportation costs of supplying the stores?", "sense": "min", "version": "v1"}, "sets": [{"name": "Centers", "elements": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7"], "description": "Potential distribution centers"}, {"name": "Stores", "elements": ["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"], "description": "Retail stores needing supply"}], "params": [{"name": "opening_cost", "indices": ["Centers"], "values": {"1": 151000.0, "2": 192000.0, "3": 114000.0, "4": 171000.0, "5": 160000.0, "6": 120000.0, "7": 182000.0}, "description": "Opening costs for each distribution center"}, {"name": "transport_cost", "indices": ["Centers", "Stores"], "values": {"1": {"1": 3.0, "2": 3.0, "3": 5.0, "4": 4.0, "5": 3.0}, "2": {"1": 5.0, "2": 2.0, "3": 4.0, "4": 2.0, "5": 4.0}, "3": {"1": 5.0, "2": 1.0, "3": 4.0, "4": 2.0, "5": 5.0}, "4": {"1": 4.0, "2": 1.0, "3": 1.0, "4": 3.0, "5": 3.0}, "5": {"1": 2.0, "2": 4.0, "3": 4.0, "4": 3.0, "5": 4.0}, "6": {"1": 4.0, "2": 1.0, "3": 3.0, "4": 5.0, "5": 3.0}, "7": {"1": 5.0, "2": 1.0, "3": 2.0, "4": 4.0, "5": 1.0}}, "description": "Transportation cost per unit from each center to each store"}, {"name": "demand", "indices": ["Stores"], "values": {"1": 715.0, "2": 413.0, "3": 641.0, "4": 745.0, "5": 964.0}, "description": "Demand of each retail store"}, {"name": "capacity", "indices": ["Centers"], "values": {"1": 1697.0, "2": 891.0, "3": 1755.0, "4": 1308.0, "5": 1575.0, "6": 834.0, "7": 1005.0}, "description": "Supply capacity of each distribution center"}], "vars": [{"name": "y", "indices": ["Centers"], "vartype": "binary", "lb": 0.0, "ub": 1.0, "description": "Binary variable indicating if a center is opened"}, {"name": "x", "indices": ["Centers", "Stores"], "vartype": "continuous", "lb": 0.0, "ub": null, "description": "Units transported from center to store"}], "objective": {"name": "total_cost", "sense": "min", "expr": "quicksum(opening_cost[c] * y[c] for c in Centers) + quicksum(transport_cost[c][s] * x[c][s] for c in Centers for s in Stores)", "description": "Minimize total opening and transportation costs"}, "constraints": [{"name": "demand_s1", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x[c]['1'] for c in Centers)", "sense": ">=", "expr_rhs": "demand['1']", "description": "Meet demand for store 1"}, {"name": "demand_s2", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x[c]['2'] for c in Centers)", "sense": ">=", "expr_rhs": "demand['2']", "description": "Meet demand for store 2"}, {"name": "demand_s3", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x[c]['3'] for c in Centers)", "sense": ">=", "expr_rhs": "demand['3']", "description": "Meet demand for store 3"}, {"name": "demand_s4", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x[c]['4'] for c in Centers)", "sense": ">=", "expr_rhs": "demand['4']", "description": "Meet demand for store 4"}, {"name": "demand_s5", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x[c]['5'] for c in Centers)", "sense": ">=", "expr_rhs": "demand['5']", "description": "Meet demand for store 5"}, {"name": "capacity_c1", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x['1'][s] for s in Stores)", "sense": "<=", "expr_rhs": "capacity['1'] * y['1']", "description": "Do not exceed capacity of center 1"}, {"name": "capacity_c2", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x['2'][s] for s in Stores)", "sense": "<=", "expr_rhs": "capacity['2'] * y['2']", "description": "Do not exceed capacity of center 2"}, {"name": "capacity_c3", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x['3'][s] for s in Stores)", "sense": "<=", "expr_rhs": "capacity['3'] * y['3']", "description": "Do not exceed capacity of center 3"}, {"name": "capacity_c4", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x['4'][s] for s in Stores)", "sense": "<=", "expr_rhs": "capacity['4'] * y['4']", "description": "Do not exceed capacity of center 4"}, {"name": "capacity_c5", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x['5'][s] for s in Stores)", "sense": "<=", "expr_rhs": "capacity['5'] * y['5']", "description": "Do not exceed capacity of center 5"}, {"name": "capacity_c6", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x['6'][s] for s in Stores)", "sense": "<=", "expr_rhs": "capacity['6'] * y['6']", "description": "Do not exceed capacity of center 6"}, {"name": "capacity_c7", "expr_lhs": "quicksum(x['7'][s] for s in Stores)", "sense": "<=", "expr_rhs": "capacity['7'] * y['7']", "description": "Do not exceed capacity of center 7"}]}, "eval": {"ground_truth_raw": "393863.0", "ground_truth_value": 393863.0, "obj_value": 393863.0, "status": "OPTIMAL", "correct": 1}}

It sells two products to gas stations: regular and premium gasoline. It makes these two final products by blending together four raw gasolines and some chemical additives (the amount and cost of the additives per barrel are assumed to be independent of the mixture). Each gasoline has an octane rating that reflects its energy content. The four types of raw gasoline have octane ratings and daily availability as follows: raw gasoline 1 with 86 octane is available up to 20,000 barrels per day at a cost of $17.00 per barrel, raw gasoline 2 with 88 octane can be purchased up to 15,000 barrels per day at $18.00 per barrel, raw gasoline 3 with 92 octane is available up to 15,000 barrels daily at $20.50 per barrel, and raw gasoline 4 with 96 octane has a daily availability of 10,000 barrels at $23.00 per barrel. The required minimum octane for each final gasoline product is 89 for regular, which sells at $19.50 per barrel with a maximum daily demand of 35,000 barrels, and 93 for premium gasoline, priced at $22.00 per barrel with a demand of up to 23,000 barrels per day. Solar Oil can sell all the gas it produces up to that amount. The blending of gasoline is approximately a linear operation in terms of volume and octane. If x barrels of 80 octane gasoline are blended with y barrels of 90 octane gasoline, this produces x + y barrels of gasoline with an octane of (80x + 90y)/(x+y). There is no significant volume gain or loss, and octane of the mixture is a weighted average of the octanes of the inputs.

Sailco must meet demands on time. At the beginning of the first quarter, Sailco has an inventory of 10 sailboats.

For simplicity, we assume that sailboats manufactured during a quarter can be used to meet demand for that quarter. During each quarter, Sailco can produce up to 40 sailboats with regular-time labor at a total cost of $400 per sailboat. By having employees work overtime during a quarter, Sailco can produce additional sailboats with overtime labor at a total cost of $450 per sailboat. At the end of each quarter (after production has occurred and the current quarter’s demand has been satisfied), a carrying or holding cost of $20 per sailboat is incurred.
