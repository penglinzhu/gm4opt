{"id": 202, "Question": "International Wool Company operates a large farm on which sheep are raised. The farm manager determined that for the sheep to grow in the desired fashion, they need at least minimum amounts of four nutrients (the nutrients are nontoxic so the sheep can consume more than the minimum without harm). The manager is considering three different grains to feed the sheep. The nutrients listed are A, B, C, and D. For Grain 1: Nutrient A is present in the amount of 20 units per pound. Nutrient B is present in the amount of 10 units per pound. Nutrient C is present in the amount of 50 units per pound. Nutrient D is present in the amount of 6 units per pound. The cost of Grain 1 is 41 cents per pound. For Grain 2: Nutrient A is present in the amount of 30 units per pound. Nutrient B is present in the amount of 10 units per pound. Nutrient C is present in the amount of 30 units per pound. Nutrient D is present in the amount of 2.5 units per pound. The cost of Grain 2 is 36 cents per pound. For Grain 3: Nutrient A is present in the amount of 70 units per pound. Nutrient B is present in the amount of 0 units per pound. Nutrient C is present in the amount of 0 units per pound. Nutrient D is present in the amount of 10 units per pound. The cost of Grain 3 is 96 cents per pound. The minimum daily requirement for each nutrient is also listed: Nutrient A requires 110 units daily. Nutrient B requires 18 units daily. Nutrient C requires 90 units daily. Nutrient D requires 14 units daily. The manager believes that as long as a sheep receives the minimum daily amount of each nutrient, it will be healthy and produce a standard amount of wool. The manager wants to raise the sheep at minimum cost. Find the minimum cost in cents.", "Answer": "148.6", "Category": "optimization", "Type": "complex_lp"}
{"id": 204, "Question": "Solar Oil Company is a gasoline refiner and wholesaler. It sells two products to gas stations: regular and premium gasoline. It makes these two final products by blending together four raw gasolines and some chemical additives (the amount and cost of the additives per barrel are assumed to be independent of the mixture). Each gasoline has an octane rating that reflects its energy content. The four types of raw gasoline have octane ratings and daily availability as follows: raw gasoline 1 with 86 octane is available up to 20,000 barrels per day at a cost of $17.00 per barrel, raw gasoline 2 with 88 octane can be purchased up to 15,000 barrels per day at $18.00 per barrel, raw gasoline 3 with 92 octane is available up to 15,000 barrels daily at $20.50 per barrel, and raw gasoline 4 with 96 octane has a daily availability of 10,000 barrels at $23.00 per barrel. The required minimum octane for each final gasoline product is 89 for regular, which sells at $19.50 per barrel with a maximum daily demand of 35,000 barrels, and 93 for premium gasoline, priced at $22.00 per barrel with a demand of up to 23,000 barrels per day. Solar Oil can sell all the gas it produces up to that amount. The blending of gasoline is approximately a linear operation in terms of volume and octane. If x barrels of 80 octane gasoline are blended with y barrels of 90 octane gasoline, this produces x + y barrels of gasoline with an octane of (80x + 90y)/(x+y). There is no significant volume gain or loss, and octane of the mixture is a weighted average of the octanes of the inputs.

{"id": 207, "Question": "Sailco Corporation must determine how many sailboats should be produced during each of the next four quarters (one quarter  three months). The demand during each of the next four quarters is as follows: first quarter, 40 sailboats; second quarter, 60 sailboats; third quarter, 75 sailboats; fourth quarter, 25 sailboats. Sailco must meet demands on time. At the beginning of the first quarter, Sailco has an inventory of 10 sailboats. At the beginning of each quarter, Sailco must decide how many sailboats should be produced during that quarter. For simplicity, we assume that sailboats manufactured during a quarter can be used to meet demand for that quarter. During each quarter, Sailco can produce up to 40 sailboats with regular-time labor at a total cost of $400 per sailboat. By having employees work overtime during a quarter, Sailco can produce additional sailboats with overtime labor at a total cost of $450 per sailboat. At the end of each quarter (after production has occurred and the current quarter\u2019s demand has been satisfied), a carrying or holding cost of $20 per sailboat is incurred. Use linear programming to determine a production schedule to minimize the sum of production and inventory costs during the next four quarters. Find the minimal sum.", "Answer": "78450", "Category": "optimization", "Type": "complex_lp"}
