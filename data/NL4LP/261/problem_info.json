{"parametrized_description": "A hospital prepares two types of medication: medication patches and anti-biotic creams. Each batch of medication patches requires PreparationTimeMedicationPatch minutes to prepare and MaterialRequiredMedicationPatch units of materials. Each batch of anti-biotic creams requires PreparationTimeAntiBioticCream minutes to prepare and MaterialRequiredAntiBioticCream units of materials. Since anti-biotic creams are used more often, the number of batches of anti-biotic creams must be at least MinRatioAntiBioticCreamToMedicationPatch times the number of batches of medication patches. Due to storage constraints, the total number of batches of medication patches and anti-biotic creams cannot exceed MaxTotalBatches. The hospital has AvailableStaffTime minutes of staff time available and AvailableMaterials units of materials. Each batch of medication patches can treat TreatmentPerBatchMedicationPatch people, and each batch of anti-biotic creams can treat TreatmentPerBatchAntiBioticCream people.
