{"parametrized_description": "A laundromat can buy two types of washing machines, a top-loading model and a front-loading model. The top-loading model can wash WashRateTopLoading items per day while the front-loading model can wash WashRateFrontLoading items per day. The top-loading model consumes EnergyConsumptionTopLoading kWh per day while the front-loading model consumes EnergyConsumptionFrontLoading kWh per day. The laundromat must be able to wash at least MinItemsPerDay items per day and has available MaxEnergyPerDay kWh per day. Since the top-loading machines are harder to use, at most MaxFractionTopLoading of the machines can be top-loading. Further, at least MinNumFrontLoading machines should be front-loading.
