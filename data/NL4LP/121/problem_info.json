{"parametrized_description": "In a science club, there are NumTables different tables for making slime. At each table i, PowderUsed[i] units of powder and GlueUsed[i] units of glue are used to produce SlimeProduced[i] units of slime. Each table i also generates MessProduced[i] units of mess. The club has AvailablePowder units of powder and AvailableGlue units of glue available. Additionally, no more than MaxMess units of mess can be created.
