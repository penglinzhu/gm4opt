{"parametrized_description": "A company produces two types of flooring products: laminate planks and carpets. Let the production levels of laminate planks and carpets be represented by variables. The objective is to maximize the total profit, which is calculated by multiplying the production level of laminate planks by LaminateProfitPerSqFt and the production level of carpets by CarpetProfitPerSqFt, then summing these two amounts. The production levels must satisfy the following constraints: the production of laminate planks must be at least MinLaminateDemand and no more than MaxLaminateProduction; the production of carpets must be at least MinCarpetDemand and no more than MaxCarpetProduction; and the combined production of both products must meet or exceed MinTotalShipping.", "keywords": ["N.A."], "parameters": {"MinLaminateDemand": {"description": "Minimum weekly demand for laminate planks", "shape": []}, "MinCarpetDemand": {"description": "Minimum weekly demand for carpets", "shape": []}, "MinTotalShipping": {"description": "Minimum total weekly shipping requirement", "shape": []}, "MaxLaminateProduction": {"description": "Maximum weekly production capacity for laminate planks", "shape": []}, "MaxCarpetProduction": {"description": "Maximum weekly production capacity for carpets", "shape": []}, "LaminateProfitPerSqFt": {"description": "Profit per square foot for laminate planks", "shape": []}, "CarpetProfitPerSqFt": {"description": "Profit per square foot for carpets", "shape": []}}, "variables": {"LaminateProduction": {"description": "The weekly production level of laminate planks", "type": "continuous", "shape": []}, "CarpetProduction": {"description": "The weekly production level of carpets", "type": "continuous", "shape": []}}, "constraints": [{"description": "The production level of laminate planks must be at least MinLaminateDemand.", "formulation": "LaminateProduction \\geq MinLaminateDemand", "code": {"gurobipy": "model.addConstr(LaminateProduction >= MinLaminateDemand)"}}, {"description": "The production level of laminate planks must be no more than MaxLaminateProduction.", "formulation": "LaminateProduction \\leq MaxLaminateProduction", "code": {"gurobipy": "model.addConstr(LaminateProduction <= MaxLaminateProduction, \"LaminateProductionLimit\")"}}, {"description": "The production level of carpets must be at least MinCarpetDemand.", "formulation": "CarpetProduction \\geq MinCarpetDemand", "code": {"gurobipy": "model.addConstr(CarpetProduction >= MinCarpetDemand)"}}, {"description": "The production level of carpets must be no more than MaxCarpetProduction.", "formulation": "CarpetProduction \\leq MaxCarpetProduction", "code": {"gurobipy": "model.addConstr(CarpetProduction <= MaxCarpetProduction)"}}, {"description": "The combined production levels of laminate planks and carpets must meet or exceed MinTotalShipping.", "formulation": "LaminateProduction + CarpetProduction \\geq MinTotalShipping", "code": {"gurobipy": "model.addConstr(LaminateProduction + CarpetProduction >= MinTotalShipping)"}}], "objective": {"description": "Total profit is calculated by multiplying the production level of laminate planks by LaminateProfitPerSqFt and the production level of carpets by CarpetProfitPerSqFt, then summing these two amounts.
