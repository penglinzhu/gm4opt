{"parametrized_description": "A chocolate shop produces two types of chocolate bars: milk and dark. Producing one milk chocolate bar requires CocoaPerMilkBar units of cocoa and MilkPerMilkBar units of milk. Producing one dark chocolate bar requires CocoaPerDarkBar units of cocoa and MilkPerDarkBar units of milk. The shop has TotalCocoa units of cocoa and TotalMilk units of milk available. At least MinMilkToDarkRatio times as many milk chocolate bars as dark chocolate bars must be produced.
