A certain restaurant operates 24 hours a day and requires a minimum number of waitstaff as shown in Table 1.1.

Table 1.1

| Time | Minimum Number of Waitstaff |
| :---: | :---: |
| 2am-6am | 4 |
| 6am-10am | 8 |
| 10am-2pm | 10 |
| 2pm-6pm | 4 |
| 6pm-10pm | 8 |
| 10pm-2am | 4 |

Each waitstaff works continuously for 8 hours a day. The goal is to find the minimum number of waitstaff that satisfies the above conditions and represent this problem as a linear programming model.
