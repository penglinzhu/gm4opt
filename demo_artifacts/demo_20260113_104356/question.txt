Red Star Plastic Factory produces 6 types of plastic containers, with their capacities, demands, and variable costs shown in Table 5-11.
Table 5-11
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c}
\hline Container Code & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 \
\hline Capacity $(\mathrm{cm}^3)$ & 1500 & 2500 & 4000 & 6000 & 9000 & 12000 \
Demand/units & 500 & 550 & 700 & 900 & 400 & 300 \
Variable Cost/(¥/unit) & 5 & 8 & 10 & 12 & 16 & 18 \
\hline
\end{tabular}

Each type of container is produced using different dedicated equipment, with a fixed cost of ¥1200. When the quantity of a certain container cannot meet the demand, containers with larger capacities can be used as substitutes. How should production be organized to minimize the total cost while meeting the demand?
