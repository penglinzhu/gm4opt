The Zhang family has 6 children, Harry, Hermione, Ron, Fred, George, and Ginny. The cost of taking Harry is $1200, Hermione is $1650, Ron is $750, Fred is $800, George is $800, and Ginny is $1500. Which children should the couple take to minimize the total cost of taking the children?

They can take a maximum of 4 children on the upcoming trip.

Ginny is the youngest, so the Zhang family will definitely take her.

If the couple takes Harry, they will not take Fred because Harry doesn't get along with him.

If the couple takes Harry, they will not take George because Harry doesn't get along with him.

If they take George, they must also take Fred.

If they take George, they must also take Hermione.

Although this will cost them a lot of money, the Zhang family has decided to take at least three children.
