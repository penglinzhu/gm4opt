Now we need to determine 4 out of 5 workers to each complete one of the four tasks. Since each worker has different skill sets, the amount of time required for each worker to complete each task is also different. The time required for each worker to complete each task is shown in Table 5-2.
Table 5-2
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline Task Time Required & $A$ & $B$ & $C$ & $D$ \\
\hline Worker & & & & \\
\hline I & 9 & 4 & 3 & 7 \\
\hline II & 4 & 6 & 5 & 6 \\
\hline III & 5 & 4 & 7 & 5 \\
\hline IV & 7 & 5 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline V & 10 & 6 & 7 & 4 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
