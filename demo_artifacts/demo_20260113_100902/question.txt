A production base needs to extract raw materials from warehouses A and B every day for production. The required amounts of raw materials are: at least 240 units of material A, at least 80 kg of material B, and at least 120 tons of material C. It is known that each truck from warehouse A can transport 4 units of material A, 2 kg of material B, and 6 tons of material C, with a freight cost of $200 per truck. Each truck from warehouse B can transport 7 units of material A, 2 kg of material B, and 2 tons of material C, with a freight cost of $160 per truck. The question is: to meet the production needs, how many trucks should the production base send to warehouses A and B each day to minimize the total freight cost?
