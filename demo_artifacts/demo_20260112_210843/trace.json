      "description": "A master's student majoring in Operations Research at a certain university is required to take two math courses, two operations research courses, and two computer courses out of a total of seven courses: calculus, operations research, data structures, management statistics, computer simulation, computer programming, and forecasting. Some courses belong to only one category: calculus belongs to the math category, and computer programming belongs to the computer category. However, some courses are cross-categories: operations research belongs to both the operations research and math categories, data structures belongs to both the computer and math categories, management statistics belongs to both the math and operations research categories, computer simulation belongs to both the computer and operations research categories, and forecasting belongs to both the operations research and math categories. For courses that belong to two categories, taking the course can be considered as taking one course in each category. In addition, some courses require prerequisite courses: computer simulation or data structures must be taken after taking computer programming, management statistics must be taken after taking calculus, and forecasting must be taken after taking management statistics. The question is: how many and which courses should a master's student take at minimum to meet the above requirements?",
