    "description": "Tom and Jerry have just bought a farm in Sunshine Valley and are considering using it to grow corn, wheat, soybeans, and sorghum. The profit from planting one acre of corn is $1500, one acre of wheat is $1200, one acre of soybeans is $1800, and one acre of sorghum is $1600. To maximize profit, how many acres of land should Tom and Jerry use to plant each crop?\n\nThe total area of Tom and Jerry's farm is 100 acres.\n\nThe area of land used for planting corn should be at least twice the area of land used for planting wheat.\n\nThe area of land used for planting soybeans should be at least half the area of land used for planting sorghum.\n\nThe area of land used for planting wheat must be three times the area of land used for planting sorghum.",
