For a certain daytime and nighttime service bus route, the number of drivers and crew members required during each time period is given in Table 1-2:
Table 1-2
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c||c|c|c|}
\hline Shift & Time & Number Required & Shift & Time & Number Required \\
\hline 1 & $6: 00 \sim 10: 00$ & 60 & 4 & $18: 00 \sim 22: 00$ & 50 \\
\hline 2 & $10: 00 \sim 14: 00$ & 70 & 5 & $22: 00 \sim 2: 00$ & 20 \\
\hline 3 & $14: 00 \sim 18: 00$ & 60 & 6 & $2: 00 \sim 6: 00$ & 30 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}

Assuming that the drivers and crew members start working at the beginning of each time period and work continuously for 8 hours, how many drivers and crew members should be assigned to this bus route at least? Write down the linear programming model for this problem.
