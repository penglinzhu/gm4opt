      "description": "A manufacturing company needs to transport 1800 units of products from the warehouse to three different sales points. The company has four transportation options to choose from: trucks, vans, motorcycles, and electric vehicles. Due to the high energy consumption of vans and electric vehicles, the company wants to choose only one of these two transportation options. Trucks generate 100 units of pollution per trip, vans generate 50 units of pollution, motorcycles generate 10 units of pollution, and electric vehicles generate 0 units of pollution. The total pollution generated by all trips must not exceed 2000 units. Trucks must be used at least 10 times. Trucks, vans, motorcycles, and electric vehicles can carry 100 units, 80 units, 40 units, and 60 units of products per trip, respectively. The company needs to ensure that the total quantity of products transported is at least 1800 units.",
