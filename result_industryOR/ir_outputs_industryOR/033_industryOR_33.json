The profit from growing one acre of apples is $2000, of pears is $1800, of oranges is $2200, and of lemons is $3000. In order to maximize profit, how many acres of land should they use to grow each fruit?\nVicky and David just bought a farm in the Yarra Valley and are considering using it to grow apples, pears, oranges, and lemons. The total land area is 120 acres.\n\nThe land area for growing apples should be at least twice the land area for growing pears.\n\nThe land area for growing apples should be at least three times the land area for growing lemons.\n\nThe land area for growing oranges must be twice the land area for growing lemons.\n\nVicky and David are not willing to grow more than two types of fruit.",
