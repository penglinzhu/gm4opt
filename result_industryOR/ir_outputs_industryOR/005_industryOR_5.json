    "description": "The Lee family has 5 children, Alice, Bob, Charlie, Diana, and Ella. The cost of taking Alice is $1000, Bob is $900, Charlie is $600, Diana is $500, and Ella is $700. Which children should the couple take to minimize the total cost of taking the children?\nThey can take a maximum of 3 children together on the upcoming trip.\n\nBob is the youngest, so the Lee family will definitely take him.\n\nIf the couple takes Alice, they will not take Diana because Alice and Diana do not get along.\n\nIf the couple takes Bob, they will not take Charlie because Bob and Charlie do not get along.\n\nIf they take Charlie, they must also take Diana.\n\nIf they take Diana, they must also take Ella.\n\nAlthough it will cost them a lot of money, the Lee family has decided to take at least two children.",
