    "description": "Haus Toys can manufacture and sell toy trucks, toy planes, toy boats, and toy trains. The profit from selling one truck is $5, from one plane is $10, from one boat is $8, and from one train is $7. How many types of toys should Haus Toys manufacture to maximize profit?\n\nThere are 890 units of wood available. Manufacturing one truck requires 12 units of wood, one plane requires 20 units of wood, one boat requires 15 units of wood, and one train requires 10 units of wood.\n\nThere are 500 units of steel available. Manufacturing one plane requires 3 units of steel, one boat requires 5 units of steel, one train requires 4 units of steel, and one truck requires 6 units of steel.\n\nIf Haus Toys manufactures trucks, then they will not manufacture trains.\n\nHowever, if they manufacture boats, they will also manufacture planes.\n\nThe number of toy boats manufactured cannot exceed the number of toy trains manufactured.",
