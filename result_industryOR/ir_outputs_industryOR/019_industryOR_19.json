    "description": "There are two coal mines, A and B, with monthly coal supplies of at least 80 tons and 100 tons, respectively. They are responsible for supplying coal to three residential areas, which require 55 tons, 75 tons, and 50 tons of coal per month, respectively. The distances between mine A and these three residential areas are 10 kilometers, 5 kilometers, and 6 kilometers. The distances between mine B and these three residential areas are 4 kilometers, 8 kilometers, and 15 kilometers. How should these two coal mines distribute the coal to the three residential areas to minimize the ton-kilometers of transportation?",
