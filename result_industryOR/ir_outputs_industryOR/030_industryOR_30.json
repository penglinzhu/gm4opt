    "description": "The Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) was first proposed by Dantzig in 1959 (Dantzig and Ramser 1959). It is a very classic combinatorial optimization problem. The basic VRP can usually be described as follows: in a certain area, there are a certain number of customers and a distribution center or warehouse. The customers are generally distributed in different locations, and each customer has a certain amount of goods delivery demand. The distribution center or warehouse needs to dispatch a fleet of vehicles and design a suitable delivery plan to fulfill all customer's goods delivery demands. The objective of VRP is to maximize efficiency while meeting all customer demands. The measurement of efficiency is usually presented in the form of an objective function. The objective function varies with the company's requirements, and common objective functions include minimizing the total distance traveled by vehicles, minimizing the total delivery time, and minimizing the number of vehicles used, etc. In addition to meeting customer delivery demands, VRP generally needs to consider various other constraints, resulting in various variants. For example, if the vehicle's load cannot exceed its maximum capacity (capacity constraint), the problem becomes the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). If the delivery demand of each customer must be delivered within a specific time window, the problem becomes the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW).\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) is a classic problem developed from VRP. There are many applications of VRPTW in reality, and each customer point generally has a service time window. For example, some logistics centers need to deliver packages during low-traffic hours, some large supermarkets need to restock during non-business hours, and real-time delivery methods such as food delivery require specific delivery time windows. Time windows can be classified as hard time windows and soft time windows. Hard Time Windows (HTW) means that vehicles must arrive at or before the time window, and cannot delay their arrival. If they arrive early, they must wait until the time window starts to provide service, such as restocking supermarkets and delivering goods from logistics centers, etc. Soft Time Windows (STW) means that vehicles are not required to arrive within the original hard time window, but they should try to arrive within the hard time window. If the vehicle arrives early, a penalty value will be deducted, and if it arrives late, a certain penalty value will be imposed, such as food delivery, school bus pick-up and drop-off, industrial distribution, etc.\n\nThe Vehicle Routing Problem with Hard Time Windows (VRPHTW) can be described as follows: there are a certain number of customer points and a distribution center in the region. Vehicles need to depart from the distribution center and return to the distribution center. The route should be continuous, and each customer should be served by one and only one vehicle. The vehicles also have a capacity. Each customer has a specific service time window and can only be served within the time window. Vehicles can arrive at the customer point ahead of time and wait for the time window to open, then provide service to the customer. They can also arrive at the customer point within the time window to provide service. Vehicles can only start serving customers within the time window, and the service time is known. The distribution center needs to arrange a reasonable delivery plan to both complete the delivery tasks and minimize travel costs. VRPHTW, like VRP, mainly emphasizes the travel costs on the routes because delays are not allowed. Now, please model the VRPHTW in operations research.\n\n### Example\nr101.txt = r\\\"\"\"\n    0          35      35           0       0         230           0\n    1          41      49          10     161         171          10\n    2          35      17           7      50          60          "
