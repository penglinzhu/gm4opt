    "description": "A farmer needs to decide how many cows, sheep, and chickens to raise in order to maximize profit. The farmer can sell cows, sheep, and chickens for $500, $200, and $8 respectively. The feed costs for each cow, sheep, and chicken are $100, $80, and $5 respectively. Profit is the difference between the selling price and the feed cost. Cows, sheep, and chickens produce 10, 5, and 3 units of manure per day respectively. Due to limited time for farm employees to clean the farm, they can clean a maximum of 800 units of manure per day. Additionally, due to the limited size of the farm, the farmer can raise a maximum of 50 chickens. Furthermore, the farmer must have at least 10 cows to meet customer demand. The farmer must also have at least 20 sheep. Finally, the total number of animals cannot exceed 100.",
